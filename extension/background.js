/**
 * Background script
 * - MV2 (Firefox): runs as an event page (non-persistent per manifest).
 * - MV3 (Chrome): if you add a service worker later, this fileâ€™s logic can be moved there.
 *
 * Why keep it?
 * - Central place to add future logic (alarms, contextMenus, dynamic injection).
 * - Useful for message passing between popup/content if needed later.
 *
 * Cross-browser note:
 * - We rely on vendor/browser-polyfill.min.js (loaded by manifest) to provide `browser` in Chrome.
 * - As a guard, add the same tiny bootstrap here in case polyfill fails to load.
